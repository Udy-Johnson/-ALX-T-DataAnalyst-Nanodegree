    "#### Project Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks in this project are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data wrangling, which consists of:\n",
    "    - Gathering data\n",
    "    - Assessing data\n",
    "    - Cleaning data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data\n",
    "3. Reporting on:\n",
    "    A. your data wrangling efforts and \n",
    "    B. your data analyses and visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions for Gathering Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Gather each of the three pieces of data as described below in a Jupyter Notebook titled `wrangle_act.ipynb`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The WeRateDogs Twitter archive. I am giving this file to you, so imagine it as a file on hand. Download this file manually by clicking the following link: [twitter_archive_enhanced.csv](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/59a4e958_twitter-archive-enhanced/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (`image_predictions.tsv`) is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library and the following URL: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each tweet's retweet count and favorite (\"like\") count at minimum, and any additional data you find interesting. Using the *tweet IDs* in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/) library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called **`tweet_json.txt`** file. Each tweet's JSON data should be written to its own line. Then read this .txt file line by line into a pandas DataFrame with (at minimum):\n",
    "    - tweet ID \n",
    "    - retweet count \n",
    "    - favorite count \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: do not include your Twitter API keys, secrets, and tokens in your project submission.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to complete your project in the Project Workspace, note that you can upload files to the Jupyter Notebook Workspace by clicking the \"Upload\" button in the top righthand corner of the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key points to keep in mind when data wrangling for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You only want original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.\n",
    "- Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time, and is not necessary to practice and demonstrate your skills in data wrangling. Therefore, the requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least **8 quality issues** and at least **2 tidiness issues** in this dataset.\n",
    "- Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of [tidy data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html).\n",
    "- The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This [unique rating system](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent) is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.\n",
    "- You do not need to gather the tweets beyond **August 1st, 2017**. You can, but note that you won't be able to gather the image predictions for these tweets since you don't have access to the algorithm used."

For tweets that reference multiple stages, the `stage` will include additional stages, such as: doggo|pupper, doggo|floofer, and doggo|puppo.\n"
